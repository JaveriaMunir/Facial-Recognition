# Facial Recognition
 Real-time Facial and expression recognition
           
           
           facial_recog_emotions.py uses DeepFace.
          
           facial_analysis.py uses face cascade classifier and image resizing for optimization with DeepFace.
           
           FER_analysis.py uses a "Facial Expression Recognition" model with GPU acceleration, frame processing optimization (frame resizing and confidence threshold), smoothing and averaging to reduce jitter and improve stability in the detected emotion.
